# Simple Monoped Robot

This repo consists of a monoped robot which comprises of four links and three joints, 
with all three joints equipped with actuators and physics simulations. 
The primary objective of this simulation was to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL), 
specifically Q-learning, to train the monoped to achieve hopping behavior. 

The training of monoped using RL techniques is in progress!!

The simulations were performed on [Constructsim](https://www.theconstructsim.com) platform.
